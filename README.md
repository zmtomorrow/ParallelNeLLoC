# ParallelNeLLoC

This is a demo to do lossless compression with parrallel NeLLoC.

See https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02639 for an introduction of the vanilla NeLLoC.

See https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05213 for the details of the parrallel NeLLoC.

## 2022-06-25
This version significantly improves the compression and decompression speed.

### Updates:
1. We change the Arithmetic coding to ANS coding
2. We propose ShearLoC, which has more efficient memory access.

*Note: The corresponding ArXiv paper will be updated on 2022-06-28.*
