# ParallelNeLLoC

This is a demo to do lossless compression with parrallel NeLLoC.

See [On the Out-of-Distribution Generalization of Probabilistic Image Modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02639) for an introduction of the vanilla NeLLoC.

See [Parallel Neural Local Lossless Compression
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05213) for the details of the parrallel NeLLoC.



## Updates (2022-06-25)
We propose **Shear**ed **Lo**cal Lossless **C**ompression (**ShearLoC**), which allows more efficient memory access during inference.

The ShearLoC model is inspired by an anamorphic skull
 appears in the oil painting "[The Ambassadors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ambassadors_(Holbein))" by [Hans Holbein the Younger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Holbein_the_Younger).
